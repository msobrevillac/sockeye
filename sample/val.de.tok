there are many who have a sense of urgency , quietly watching how things develop , you are dragons coiling , you are tigers crouching , i admire noble @-@ minded patriots .
has history given us too many lessons ? , 530 , 412 , 64
taking a look
the ones who are suffering are the ordinary people : even if the body of a salted fish is turned over , it is still a salted fish ...
freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
what is more they are considered traitors of location_0 , which is a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism .
in fact , the location_0 no longer needs to use force to deal with location_1 , they have achieved the result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting ".
is the article too intense , is the location_0 so good ?
if things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself , do not assume their existence , quantity_0 people create a tiger .
just passing by and taking a look . won't express my opinion
